In this course, you will write a campaign strategy memo and an op-ed. In addition, you will also build a concept map that helps you organize and connect the material we will cover in class. You can find more information about each assignment below and in their respective pages.


## Campaign Strategy Memo (15% of final grade)

You will write a campaign strategy memo (3-5 pages, single-spaced) for a member of House of Representatives. Since there is an upcoming election, you will write the memo as if you were part of a real campaign for a real candidate who will be running in the November 2024 election. You will pick a member of Congress and write a memo covering the demographics of the member's constituency, the roll call record of the member, and the topics the campaign should focus on.^[Papers must be submitted via Canvas. Late submissions will be penalized with one point off for each 24-hour period after the due date.] 


## Op-ed (15% of final grade)

You will write an op-ed for the college newspaper (no actual submission necessary) on a topic of American politics of their choice.


## Concept Map (20% of final grade)

Throughout the course you will build a concept map that helps you organize and connect the material we will cover in class. At the end of each major section of the course, you will submit the current draft of your concept map (see schedule below). Since you will be incorporating new material each week, your concept map will evolve; some pieces of information may be removed, for example, to add others. The goal is to help you integrate new material and make connections with existing knowledge.

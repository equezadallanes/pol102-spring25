In the first part of the course, we will talk about the foundations of the American system (the Constitution, federalism, civil rights and liberties). In Part II, we will cover the major institutions of American government (Congress, the presidency, the bureaucracy, and the judiciary). In Part III, we will examine the role of public opinion, political parties, elections, and the media in American politics. In addition to these topics, the course will also introduce you to the methods political scientists use."

Thousand Oaks, California: CQ Press/SAGE.\n\n\n\nCourse Expectations\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate during class discussions. This course has both a lecture and a discussion component. The lectures will incorporate the readings assigned for that day/week. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with comments and questions. Unless noted otherwise, all readings will be made available on Canvas.\n\nIf you do not have a subscription to The New York Times, please sign up through the school here: https://accessnyt.com/\n\n\n\nCourse Workload\nThis is a 4-credit hour course, meaning that you are expected to spend 12 hours of work each week (including the 3 hours spent in the classroom). This roughly means that you will spend about 2 hours on readings for each class period, and 3 hours each week working on the different assignments (pace yourself!).\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n&lt; 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (10%): All students are expected to be active participants in class discussions. Our learning experience will be enhanced if you come prepared and ready to share your comments, insights, and/or questions from the material covered in the lectures and readings with the rest of the class.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have three unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester.\n\nThree Response Papers (10% each): Throughout the course, we will talk about the state of American democracy. After each of the major sections of the course (foundations, institutions, and the public) you will return to the question of whether American democracy is fragile or stable. In these short papers (2 double-space pages) you will discuss how the different foundations, institutions, or players in American politics contribute to the resilience or erosion of democracy in the United States.\nCampaign Memo Assignments: The major assignment in this course will conclude in a campaign memo for a member of the House of Representatives. You will pick a representative and write a campaign strategy memo. This memo should be directed to campaign staff and should include clear actions and sufficient (but not overwhelming) justification. There are four different assignments that will be due throughout the semester: the demographics of the member’s constituency, the roll call record of the member, and the topics the campaign should focus on:\n\nCongressmember Profile (10%): This 1-2 page, single-spaced, paper should describe the political career (electoral history, roll-call record, bill sponsorship, etc.) of the member of Congress you chose for your campaign memo.\nCongressional District Profile (10%): This 1-2 page, single-spaced, paper should describe the demographic and political characteristics of the congressional district your member of Congress represents.\nFull draft for peer review (5%): Using the research you did in the previous two papers, this is the first full draft of the campaign strategy memo (3-5 single-spaced pages) directed at the campaign staff.

Late submissions will be penalized with one point off for each 24-hour period after the due date.\n\nMidterm and Final Exam (10% each): There will be a midterm and a final exam that students will complete on Canvas. These exams will assess your familiarity with the terms and theories in the American politics literature that we will have covered in class."

The Agnes Scott College honor code embodies an ideal of character, conduct, and citizenship, and is an important part of the College’s mission and core identity. This applies especially to academic honesty and integrity. Passing off someone else’s work (or Chat GPT’s) as your own represents intellectual fraud and theft and violates the core values of our academic community. To be honorable, you should understand not only what counts as academic dishonesty, but also how to avoid engaging in these practices.\nYou are responsible for the content of any work submitted for this course. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a first draft of text is permitted, but you must review and revise any AI-generated text before submission. AI text generators can be useful tools but they are often prone to factual errors, incorrect or fabricated citations, and misinterpretations of abstract concepts. I neither encourage nor discourage their use, but utilize them with caution."

Doing peer review turns you into a serious reader who is trying to understand the main thesis of a piece of writing as well as the arguments. The goal is to provide feedback to help the writer convey their argument in a clear and concise manner.\n\n\nGuidelines\nAs you read one another’s work, I want you to be constructively ruthless and nice. These terms are not mutually exclusive. Point out what is well done and areas for improvement (organization, formatting, missing information, unsupported conclusions, etc.). You can use the following questions as a guide to evaluate the draft:\n\nDoes the memo provide clear takeaways on the first page?\nIs the purpose of the memo clear?\nDoes the memo describe the demographic characteristics of the congressional district?\nGiven the characteristics of the candidate, does the memo provide an answer to whether and how the candidate should reach out to potential voters?\nDoes the memo provide clear, actionable strategies for the campaign staff?\nDoes the memo use data and appropriately cite sources (e.g., using footnotes)?\nDoes the memo provide sufficient information without overwhelming the reader?\nDoes the memo’s organization help effectively communicate the main points?\nDoes the memo use headers in a clear way? Are the paragraphs single spaced? Is there space between paragraphs? Does the memo use lists and bullet points appropriately?\n\nYou can also ask these questions of your own work. In fact, these are the same questions I’ll be thinking about when I grade the memos.",
